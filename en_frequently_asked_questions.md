## Q1. What is the environment requirements?

Support Windows 10.

For LipSync you can use not only normal (physical) microphone input but also virtual microphone, which means you can use voice-changed input.

Preffered webcam for the face tracking is the one with narrow FOV (field of view). Low resolution camera is available, because VMagicMirror uses compressed webcam input with about 320x240 px.

VMagicMirror has almost no minimum requirement for the CPU and GPU, but it would be better for the middle ended PC to disable face tracking, shadow, or LipSync if you have performance issue.

The developer checks VMagicMirror performance on the following environments.

* 1: Desktop PC
    + CPU: Intel Core i7-6700K
    + GPU: GeForce GTX 1080
