# Tips A: Desktop Mascot Setup

[Japanese](./tips_desktop_mascot.html)

VMagicMirror is also available as a desktop mascot software.

This section shows how to setup to show your character when Windows has started.

## Tips A.1. VMagicMirror Setup

* Follow [2: Getting Started](./en_get_started.html) to show your character and setup background transparency, and so on.
* Follow [3: Settings](./en_about_settings.html) > "3.1. Window" to fix the character position.
* On the control panel `Home` tab, confirm the `Load current VRM on next startup` check is on.

For the test, quit VMagicMirror and restart. If you can see the character with the specified position, your setup is successful.


## Tips A.2. Start VMagicMirror on Windows startup

In the control panel `Home` tab, check on `Start on Windows startup` at the left bottom side. After this setup, you can check if the thing goes good to restart Windows.

When you replace the VMagicMirror with different version, or want to disable automatic startup, then turn off `Start on Windows startup`.
