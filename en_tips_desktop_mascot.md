# Tips A: Desktop Mascot Setup

[Japanese](./tips_desktop_mascot.html)

VMagicMirror is also available as a desktop mascot software.

This section shows how to setup to show your character when Windows has started.

## Tips A.1. VMagicMirror Setup

* Follow [2: Getting Started](./en_get_started.html) to show your character and setup background transparency, and so on.
* Follow [3: Settings](./en_about_settings.html) > "3.1. Window" to fix the character position.
* On the control panel `Home` tab, confirm the `Load current VRM on next startup` check is on.

For the test, quit VMagicMirror and restart. If you can see the character with the specified position, your setup is successful.


## Tips A.2. Start VMagicMirror on Windows startup

* Right click `VmagicMirror.exe` and create shortcut.
* Move shortcut to Windows startup folder.

Typically the startup folder path is like this.

`C:\Users\(UserName)\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Startup`

Please replace `UserName` and necessary drive name.

After this setup, you can check if the thing goes good to restart Windows.

If the setup is successful, VMagicMirror start configuration dialog will appear when Windows has started.

If you will replace the VMagicMirror with different version, or want to disable automatic startup, then delete the shortcut from the startup folder.
