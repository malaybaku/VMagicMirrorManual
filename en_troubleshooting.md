# 4. Troubleshooting

[Japanese](./troubleshooting.html)

## 4.1. Cannot click control panel or other application near to the character

Try to click and drag, and see if the character moves.

If the character moves, then move (s)he to far from the application you want to access, and then retry.

If the problem happens many times, then adjust the position and check off `(When Transparent) Drag character` in `Streaming` tab on control panel.

Please see [2: Getting Started](./en_get_started.html) > "2.3.1. Window" also.

## 4.2. VMagicMirror stops soon after started

Setting file might be broken in this case, so please try to reset the settings.

* Press `Reset` on the control panel `Home` tab, and then press `OK` on the confirmation dialog to reset settings.
    + If it recovers the situation, please follow [2: Get Started](./en_get_started.html) to setup.
* If the problem still remains, exit VMagicMirror.
* Open the folder in which `VMagicMirror.exe` exists, and then delete `_autosave` file in `ConfigApp` folder. Then try to restatt.

### 4.3. Too high CPU usage

When you are using v0.8.0 or older, set `Graphics Quality` to `High` when starting VMagicMirror.

**WARN:** In v0.8.0, some machine with `Medium` or lower setting drastically increases CPU usage. It is a known issue.

If the CPU usage continues to be high, then disable lip sync and face tracking on `Streaming` tab on control panel.

If you do not use game pad, then: 

* Open setting window by clicking `Open setting window` at `Home` tab in on control panel.
* Check off `Layout` > `GamePad` > `Enable Input Capture`.


### 4.4. Eyes do not move by mouse pointer 

It is by specification, for some game software (please see detail in *note*).

Using fixed eye motion might improve appearance. 

* Control panel > `Streaming` tab > `Face` > `Eye Look Target` > select `None`


*note*: Cause of the trouble is as following.

Some game runs program to move mouse position to the center of game window. 

(FPS games need this type of program to support mouse-based camera control without getting unexpected mouse position.)

It results the fixed mouse position and eye / head position of character, even if you are moving mouse physically.

One example of the popular software which leads the trouble is VRChat Desktop Mode.


### 4.5. Eye Blink tracking does not work

If you put on glasses, try without them.

Some frame with thick frame prevents face tracking system.

If not, please check following points to help face tracking system.

* Proper distance from camera
* The room is bright
* Neck and face outline is clear
* Show mouth to the camera (*it is okay the microphone partly hide your mouth)

Showing entire face helps eye blink tracking, because face tracking system finds your face by detecting your whole face landmark points (including mouth, eyebrows, and of course eyes).

## 4.6. After loading VRM character window seems disappear

This issue might happen when you have changed display resolution or placement.

In this case, you can reset the window position.

* Move Control panel to near to the left top side of screen.
* Open setting window and show `Window` tab to select `Reset Character Position`.
    + If you could find character then [2: Get Started](./en_get_started.html) will support your setup.
* If the character still does not appear, then turn off `Transparent Background` on setting window `Window` tab and check if you can see green window at the right side of control panel.
* Setting window `Layout` tab, see `Camera` menu, and press `Reset Position` to reset the camera position.
    + If you could find character then [2: Get Started](./en_get_started.html) will support your setup.

If you still have trouble, then please try the way in `4.2. VMagicMirror stops soon after started`.


## 4.7. Character position is not correct when starting VMagicMirror

Known issue in v0.8.1 and fixed in newer versions.

## 4.8. Nothing happens after select .vrm on `Load VRM`

Security software can be the cause of this issue, as VMagicMirror operates interprocess communication between character window and control panel.

Please try to disable the security software in this case.

As far as the creator knows, COMODO Internet Security leads this issue, but it is just an example.

## 4.9. Shadow looks not good

* It is possible the character uses `Unlit` style shader and this case shadow might not appear.
* When your model is based on VRoidStudio and texture is partially transparent, some transparent part happens to be drawn with half transparent style.

If your trouble does not match above cases, then quality setting may be a help (however CPU usage increases).

* When starting `VMagicMirror.exe` use `SHIFT+ENTER` instead of double click. This will show the quality and resolution selection dialog.
* Select `Quality Setting` item to `Very High` or `Ultra`. 

The quality setting above is saved and also used from next startup.

## 4.10. Want to hide the circle mark around the mouse pointer during `Presentation-like hand` is on

This is a new feature in v0.8.6.

In the setting window `Motion` tab, see `Arm` and turn off `Show Pointer Support` to hide the mark.

## 4.11. VMagicMirror crashed after removing game controller

VMagicMirror might crash if you unplug the game controller during VMagicMirror is active.

Please restart VMagicMirror to recover. If VMagicMirror repeats to crash, then please reboot PC.

## 4.12. When using v0.9.3, VMagicMirror control panel window does not appear

This issue happens in specific PC environment, but the cause is not clear yet.

If you encounter this issue, please consider to use v0.9.2 instead.

## 4.13. When using v0.9.3, mouse sensitibity decreases

This issue happens in specific PC environment, but the cause is not clear yet.

If you encounter this issue, please consider to use v0.9.2 instead.
